<h1> Closures </h1>
<p>A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them. In some languages, thats not possible , or a function should be written in special way to make it happen. 

<h1>Garbage Collection</h1>
<p>Usually, a Lexical Environment is removed from memory with all the variables after the function call finishes. That’s because there are no references to it. As any JavaScript object, it’s only kept in memory while it’s reachable.</p>
<p>Whenever there is a unused variable it remove that from the memory</p>
