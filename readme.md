<p>Java-Script is a synchronus single threaded languages</p>

<h1>Execution Context </h1>
<p>Consist of two regions: 1> Memory also called variable enviorment consists of key and functions
2> Code also called Thread OF execution  consist of code that needs to be executed</p>
<p>when the javascript program runs execution context get created</p>
<p>It created in two phases:
  <ui>
  <li>Memory Creation:</li>
  <p>It allocates memory to each and every variables  declared by the programmer.It stores a default values of the variable and for function it store full code of it</p>
  <hr>
  <li>Code Execution</li>
  <p>Once again js go with the code line by line , and store the values which is given by the programmer in the memory. When the code try to run the function it again create execution context in the code and again it go through with the memory execution phase for the particular function.</p>
  </ui>

  <hr>

  <h2>for managing this complex processs it manages Call Stack</h2>

  <p>Call Stack maintains the order of execution of execution context </p>
  <p>It is also known by: Execution Context Stack , Program Stack , Control Stack , Runtime Stack , Machine Stack. </p>

  <hr/>
<h1>Day 4<h1>
<h2>Hoisting</h2>
<p> we can acces the function or variables without initialize it. </p>


<hr/>

<h2>Window</h2>
<p>Global Variable  are stored inside window object.Wherever execution context is created this variable is get created..
</p>


<h1>Java Script is loosely type language: If we define a as a number we can later assign a as string also. </h1>

<h1>Lexiacal Evvoirment</h1>
<p>In order or in Hierarchi</p>


<h1>Temporal Dead Zone</h1>
<p>from hoisting till it get the value or initialize the value called as temporal zone. Whereever we try to access the variable in the temporal dead zone it willl thorw the reference-error. </p>


<h1>What is Block</h1>
<p>It Grouped statement</p>
